# Internet

## How does the internet work?
The internet is a global network of computers connected to each other which communicate through a standardized set of protocols.

It is build up out of a large number of independently operated networks. This means there is no central control.

## What is HTTP?
In a browser you type a URL **(Uniform Resource Locator)** when pressing enter the computer starts talking to another computer called a server. Your computer then asks the server for a website and that server starts talking back to you in a language called HTTP **(HyperText Transfer Protocol)** 

**HTTP** is the language used to communicate between web browsers and servers. There are different types of HTTP requests and the most basic one is the **GET** request. When surfing to facebook.com/login you are requesting the login page of facebook.

## Browsers and how they work
**HTML (HyperText Markup Lanaguage** is the language used to tell the web browser how to make the page look. This includes the actual text of the page.

Other parts like images, videos are seperate files with their own URLs that need to be requested.

If you are logging in on a website using a post request. You will mostlikely receive some sort of cookie to authorize you viewing/editing the received webpages. So everytime you request a new page you will send your cookie and the server will validate that you are who you say you are.

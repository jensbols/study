## Networking & Sockets
## Basics of Threads

Understand core concepts of network communication

Become familiar with basics of networking: internet architecture, IP addresses, TCP connections, ports.

Learn how to create java threads and how to use java IO

Learn the basics of Java sockets programming: creation and usage of sockets;

Know how to develop Client/Server TCP and UDP applications

Learn how to transfer data between server/client applications running on different machines on the network.

Code applications like: Port Scanner, Browse the Internet, Web Scraping, Get network interface properties, Validate IP Addresses, Ping a remote host

Develop more complex network applications: File Transfer Application, Small Web Server, Send Emails

In the Socket (Java Socket programming) section you will start to write simple TCP servers or TCP clients. Also, you will learn how to create a multi-user or a multithreaded server and we are going to test each written application. We will connect multiple TCP clients to a multithreaded server and we will observe the TCP server behavior and how it makes to respond to multiple clients at the same time. 

In this chapter I will cover some other important network programming topics:

Scan a remote host for open ports

Get network interface hardware information

Validate an IP address in different ways

Ping a remote host address using java code

Browse internet using java code.

Web scrapping â€“ get what data you want from a web page

UDP chapter focus on the difference between the most used Transport Layer protocols: TCP and UDP. We will write together an UDP server and an UDP client. The interesting part of this chapter comes after we will run the code. The next chapters present some useful applications:

Send an email

Transfer files between a server and a client using TCP sockets

A small web browser.
